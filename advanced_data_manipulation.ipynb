    "# What are `dplyr` and `tidyr`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many common tasks optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++). An additional feature is the ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a relational database, queries can be conducted on that database, and only the results of the query are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull back into R only what you need for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups (e.g., a time period, an experimental unit like a plot or a batch number). Moving back and forth between these formats is non-trivial, and **`tidyr`** gives you tools for this and more sophisticated data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",

    "Sometimes you may need to alter the layout of tabluar datasets while preserving the values and relationships contained within. In `surveys`, the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables associated with each record (the unit), values such as the weight or sex of each animal associated with each record. What if instead of comparing records, we wanted to compare the different mean weight of each genus between plots? (Ignoring plot_type for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this means the values in genus would become the names of column variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean weight observed on each plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to explore the relationship between the weight of different genera within, and between, the plots. The key point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure, but we have **reshaped** the data according to the observations of interest: average genus weight per plot instead of recordings per date.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do both these of transformations with two tidyr functions, **spread()** and **gather()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into values of a variable.\n",

    "1. the value column variable whose values will fill the new column variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further arguments include fill which, if set, fills in missing values with the value provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use **spread()** to transform `surveys` to find the `mean weight` of each genus in each plot over the entire survey period. We use `filter()`, `group_by()`, and `summarise()` to filter our observations and variables of interest, and create a new variable for the mean_weight."
